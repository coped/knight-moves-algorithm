# Knight Moves Algorithm
### About
Not to be confused with any Bob Seger song.

This is an algorithm that finds the shortest path a chess piece knight can take from one square to another.

This is in preparation for the eventual game of chess I make.

### How To Use
Squares on the chess board are treated similarly to coordinates on a Cartesian plane. For example:
```
A1 is [0, 0]
D4 is [3, 3]
H7 is [7, 6]

And so on...
```
